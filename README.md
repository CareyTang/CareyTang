Greetings! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student under the supervisor of Prof. Bankui Fan at BUAA in China.
My research interests are autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles, especially signal processing related works using FPGA and embedded devices.
My mission is to develop autonomous driving technologies for the social good, for a better life.
You can contact me at jw.tang@foxmail.com at present.
